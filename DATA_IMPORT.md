# The PokeAPI Data Import — Developer Guide

> **Audience:** new team members / junior engineers who need to (re)populate the game's
> data or extend what we import.
> **Scope:** what `PokeApiConnector` does, the import-vs-runtime boundary it enforces,
> how each entity is mapped from PokeAPI's JSON into our schema, and the Gen 1 domain
> decisions baked into that mapping.

## 1. TL;DR

`PokeApiConnector` is a **one-shot command-line importer**. It fetches Gen 1 data from
[pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co), writes it into our two SQLite databases, and downloads
sprite/cry assets into the web app's `wwwroot`. Run it once on a fresh checkout; after
that the game never touches PokeAPI again.

```powershell
& "C:\Users\USER\.dotnet\dotnet.exe" run --project PokeApiConnector
```

| It populates | With |
|:-------------|:-----|
| `moves.db` (`MovesDbContext`) | Gen 1 moves → `Attack` rows |
| `pokemon.db` (`PokemonDbContext`) | Gen 1 species → `PokemonSpecies` rows + `PokemonGameAvailability` rows |
| `creaturegame.Web/wwwroot/sprites/{front,back}/{id}.png` | Battle sprites |
| `creaturegame.Web/wwwroot/audio/cries/{id}.ogg` | Legacy 8-bit cries |

**Re-running is safe** — every step is idempotent (DB upserts by ID; asset downloads
skip files that already exist).

## 2. The cardinal rule: import-time vs. runtime

This is the single most important thing to understand, and it's an architectural
decision, not an implementation detail:

> **At runtime the game reads *only* our own SQLite DBs and static files. PokeAPI is
> never called by the game server or the frontend.**

`PokeApiConnector` is the *only* code allowed to talk to PokeAPI, and it runs offline,
ahead of time. Why this matters:

- **Offline & deterministic:** the game works with no internet and isn't at the mercy of
  PokeAPI uptime, rate limits, or schema changes.
- **Stability:** PokeAPI returns *current* data; mechanics drift across generations. We
  freeze a curated Gen 1 snapshot at import time so gameplay never silently changes
  under us.
- **Performance:** local SQLite reads vs. hundreds of HTTP round-trips per session.

**Consequence for you:** to change or extend game data, edit the importer / the DB /
the model (with a migration) and re-run — **never add a runtime PokeAPI call.** See
`DESIGN_GUIDES.md` → "Data Architecture: Import vs. Runtime".

## 3. The pipeline (`Program.cs`)

Six sequential steps:

1. **Ensure databases** — `EnsureDatabaseCreated()` on both contexts runs EF migrations
   (`Database.Migrate()`), creating/updating `moves.db` and `pokemon.db`.
2. **Import moves** — `MoveImport.FetchMovesByGeneration(1)`.
3. **Import species** — `PokemonImport.FetchPokemonByGeneration(1)`.
4. **Seed game availability** — `GameAvailabilitySeeder.SeedGen1Async()`.
5. **Download sprites** — `SpriteDownloader.DownloadAllAsync()`.
6. **Download cries** — `CryDownloader.DownloadAllAsync()`.

Steps 2 and 3 follow the same **index-then-detail** shape: hit the *generation* endpoint
(`/generation/1/`) to get the list of move/species URLs, then fetch each entity's detail
endpoint and map it.

## 4. The domain: what we extract and the Gen 1 decisions in the mapping

### 4.1 Moves (`MoveImport` → `Attack`)
For each move, `GET /move/{id}` → `PokeApiMove` DTO → `MapToAttack`. Straight fields:
`BaseDamage` (power), `Accuracy`, `PowerPointsMax` (pp), `Priority`, `EffectChance`,
`Description` (English short-effect), `DamageType` (parsed into our enum).

The interesting Gen 1 logic lives in the categorisation:

- **`AttackType`** ← PokeAPI `damage_class` (`physical`/`special`/else → `Undefined`).
  *(Fidelity note: in Gen 1 the physical/special split was determined by the move's
  **type**, not per move. We currently trust PokeAPI's per-move class — see §6.)*
- **Status ailment** → `StatusEffect` (paralysis/sleep/burn/poison/freeze/bad-poison),
  with `EffectChance` taken from `meta.ailment_chance` for damaging moves.
- **`IsHighCrit`** ← `meta.crit_rate > 0` (Slash, Razor Leaf, etc.).
- **`DamageCategory`** — mostly from `meta.category` (`damage-heal` → Drain, `ohko` →
  OHKO), but PokeAPI doesn't model several Gen 1 mechanics, so those are **special-cased
  by move ID**:
  - 120/153 Self-Destruct/Explosion → `SelfDestruct`
  - 69/101 Seismic Toss/Night Shade → `LevelBased`
  - 162 Super Fang → `SuperFang`
  - 49 Sonic Boom → `Fixed` (20), 82 Dragon Rage → `Fixed` (40)
- **`DrainPercent`** ← `meta.drain` for drain moves (default 50%).
- **`NeverMisses`** — Swift (ID 129) bypasses the accuracy roll.
- **Stat-stage effects** ← first `stat_changes` entry → `StatEffectStat/Delta/Target/
  Chance` (Swords Dance, Growl, …). Pure status moves always land (chance 100);
  secondary effects on damaging moves use `EffectChance`.
- **Special `MoveEffect`** by name: Haze, Leech Seed, Hyper Beam (Recharge), binding
  moves (Wrap/Bind/Clamp/Fire Spin), two-turn moves (Fly/Dig/Solar Beam/Razor Wind/
  Sky Attack), Metronome, and flinch (from `meta.flinch_chance`).

### 4.2 Species (`PokemonImport` → `PokemonSpecies`)
Each species needs **two** PokeAPI endpoints, because the data is split:

- `GET /pokemon/{id}` → stats, types, base experience.
- `GET /pokemon-species/{id}` → growth rate, capture rate, Pokédex flavor text.

`MapToSpecies` combines them. Gen 1 specifics:

- **Hard cap at 151** — the generation endpoint can include relations, so we skip
  `Id > 151`.
- **Stats** are pulled by name from the stats array. Crucially, **`BaseSpecial` ←
  `special-attack`**: Gen 1 had a *single* Special stat, so we deliberately take
  special-attack as the combined value (the engine's `GetOffensiveStat`/`GetDefensiveStat`
  both read it — see `GENERATION_SEAMS.md`).
- **Types via `past_types`** — PokeAPI returns *current* types; `past_types` records what
  changed and when. `Gen1TypeSlots` picks the earliest pre-Gen-6 historical entry if one
  exists, otherwise the current types. This is how a Pokémon whose typing changed in a
  later generation is imported with its **Gen 1 typing**, not today's.
- **Growth rate / catch rate / Pokédex entry** mapped from the species endpoint (flavor
  text has its form-feed/newline control chars stripped).

### 4.3 Game availability (`GameAvailabilitySeeder`)
This is **hand-curated domain knowledge**, not an API import, because PokeAPI doesn't
cleanly express Gen 1 per-version obtainability. It encodes:

- **Version exclusivity** — which species are *absent* from Red / Blue / Yellow (and thus
  trade-only), as hand-maintained sets with comments (e.g. Sandshrew is Blue-only).
- **Availability type** per `(species, version)` — `Wild` by default, overridden to
  `Static` (legendaries/Snorlax), `Event` (Mew), `Gift` (fossils, Hitmons, Lapras),
  `GameCorner` (Porygon, Yellow's Scyther/Pinsir/Eevee), or `Trade` (NPC in-game trades).

It clears and re-seeds cleanly each run (`ExecuteDeleteAsync` then bulk insert of all 151
× 3 versions minus exclusions).

### 4.4 Sprites & cries (`SpriteDownloader`, `CryDownloader`)
Pull PNGs (front/back) and OGG cries for IDs 1–151 into `wwwroot`, located by walking up
to the solution root. Both are **idempotent**: a file that already exists is skipped, so
re-runs only fetch what's missing. The frontend's Phaser canvas serves these as static
files (front for the enemy, back for the player); cries fall back to a Web Audio synth if
an OGG is missing.

## 5. Patterns & practices — and *why*

### 5.1 Import/runtime separation (the headline pattern)
Already covered in §2, but as a *pattern*: this is a **batch ETL boundary**. The importer
is the Extract+Transform+Load stage; the game is a pure consumer of the loaded store.
Keeping them in separate projects (`PokeApiConnector` vs. `creaturegame`/`.Web`) makes the
boundary physical — the engine can't accidentally depend on a live API.

### 5.2 DTOs + mapping = an anti-corruption layer
The `PokeApi*` classes mirror PokeAPI's JSON shape exactly; `MapToAttack` / `MapToSpecies`
translate that external shape into *our* domain model (`Attack`, `PokemonSpecies`). All
of PokeAPI's quirks, naming, and nullability are absorbed in this one layer — the battle
engine never sees a PokeAPI type. When the external schema changes, only the importer
changes. *When integrating any third-party data source, put a mapping layer between it and
your domain model.*

### 5.3 Idempotent upsert
Each entity is read with `AsNoTracking()` and then `Add`-ed or `Update`-d by primary key,
so re-running the importer is safe and converges to the same state. Trade-off we accepted:
it `SaveChangesAsync()` **per record** (hundreds of small writes). That's slow, but for a
one-shot tool run occasionally it's not worth batching — simplicity and obvious progress
logging win.

### 5.4 Encode what the API can't express — explicitly and with comments
Two places do this: move categorisation special-cased by **ID** (§4.1) and game
availability curated by **hand** (§4.3). The practice: when the source data lacks the
structure you need, encode the domain knowledge directly, **comment every magic value**
with what it represents (`// 120/153 Self-Destruct/Explosion`), and keep it all in the
importer so the runtime model stays clean. The comments are the spec.

### 5.5 Historical correctness at import time (`past_types`)
Importing the *Gen 1* typing rather than today's is a deliberate correctness step. It's a
good example of the importer's job: not "copy the API" but "produce an accurate Gen 1
snapshot." Strict-clone fidelity is decided here, once, rather than patched in the engine.

### 5.6 Resilience: fail a record, not the run
Every fetch is wrapped in try/catch with `EnsureSuccessStatusCode`, and a failure on one
move/species logs and continues. A flaky network drops a few rows you can recover on the
next run, rather than aborting the whole import.

---

## 6. Known limitations / gotchas (be honest about these)

- **Physical/Special split fidelity.** `AttackType` comes from PokeAPI's per-move
  `damage_class`, but Gen 1 derived physical/special from the move's **type**. For many
  moves these agree; a strict audit (type-based split) is a worthwhile follow-up if a
  move's category looks off. *(Not yet tracked in `TODO.md` — flag it if you confirm a
  discrepancy.)*
- **`new HttpClient()` per request.** Convenient but not best practice (socket pressure at
  scale). Tolerable here given the one-shot, low-volume nature; would be a shared client /
  `IHttpClientFactory` in long-running code.
- **Per-record `SaveChanges`.** Many round-trips; fine for a one-shot tool, not a pattern
  to copy into the web host.
- **Hardcoded Gen 1.** Move/species ranges and mappings assume Gen 1; generalising to
  other generations is future work (see the Multi-Generation section of `TODO.md`).
- **Direct `new MovesDbContext()` / `new PokemonDbContext()`.** Acceptable for a CLI tool
  (parameterless ctor + hardcoded path in `OnConfiguring`). The *web host* deliberately
  does **not** do this — it uses `IDbContextFactory` DI (see `Program.cs` of
  `creaturegame.Web`). Don't copy the CLI pattern into the server.

## 7. When to run it

- **Fresh checkout / new machine:** required — the `.db` files and assets aren't checked
  in; the importer creates and fills them.
- **After a schema migration** that adds a column the importer populates: re-run so
  existing rows get the new data (upsert updates them in place).
- **Extending the dataset** (a new move field, learnsets, more generations): edit the
  importer + model + add a migration, then re-run. Never reach for a runtime API call.
